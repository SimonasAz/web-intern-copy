## How to run the code Using Docker

## Design decisions:
- Red color for decreasing the value of the number. Red usually means decreasing like in financial losses or drops in stock market graphs, so I thought it would be pretty fitting since you're decreasing the value.
- Green color for adding uses the same reasoning as the red color. Green usually means increase so I implemented it accordingly.
- Center the "Highest number" text for better visual balance. It  just looked more aesthetically pleasing compared to when it was aligned to the left.
